		<h2 align="middle">Overview</h2>
		<p> In this project, we implemented Beizer curve evaluation, edge flip and split, normal calculation, and loop subdivision. I practiced De Casteljau's algorithm, half-edge data structures, and upsampling in the 3D space. The project teaches us to construct and modify geometric shapes from curves to meshes. It also teaches us the importance of maintaining original geometry in interpolation and approximation.

		<h3 align="middle">Part 1: Bezier Curves with 1D de Casteljau Subdivision</h3>
		<p>De Casteljau's algorithm divides the Beizer Curve into smaller segments and recursively evaluates the segments until a certain level of accuracy. In De Casteljau's algorithm, we calculate the intermediate points of the Beizer Curve’s control points and then use the new intermediate points as control points to recursively evaluate the points. Eventually, it will converge to one single point on the curve and return the value. Given n control points, it will perform n - 1 linear interpolations. 

			<br> <br>We implemented the algorithm by evaluating one step of De Casteljau's algorithm first. We evaluated a vector of points, calculated their intermediate values, and returned the intermediate points as a vector of points. Then we recursively called the function to apply evaluation to all the points in the vector and return a final interpolated vector. Below is a picture of the process with different steps.

			  <h3 align="middle">Part 2: Bezier Surfaces with Separable 1D de Casteljau </h3>
		<p>We implemented evaluateStep functions for 3D points and applied De Casteljau's algorithm to evaluate points on 2 dimensions — x and y. We used two parameters u and v to evaluate the points. After evaluating the vector of points with u, we applied the function again with v to get a final return 3D point.

			  <h3 align="middle">Part 3: Area-Weighted Vertex Normals</h3>
			  <p>We calculate the average normals of the vertex by traversing the triangles next to this vertex and taking the average weighted by their areas. We can find the half-edge of this vertex and the next edge of this half-edge and calculate the area of their formed triangle. We calculated the area by taking the cross-product of the two half-edges. Then we repeated the same step until we went back to the half-edge we started with.

			  <h3 align="middle">Part 4: Edge Flip</h3>
			  <p>To implement the edge flip operation, we reassigned the pointers to half-edges, vertices, and faces for corresponding vertices, half-edges, and faces. We first listed out all the elements involved in the two triangles, including 4 vertices, 5 edges, 2 faces, and multiple half-edges ( we thought it was not necessary to consider all half-edges). We assigned variables to represent the elements and reassigned the elements according to the diagram after the flip. The main things we changed were the half-edges of the vertices, half-edges of the edges, and half-edges of the faces. And most importantly, we used the setNeighbour function to assign the next edge, twin edge, vertex, edges, and face of our listed half-edges. One bug I encountered was I thought I needed to create two new faces because the two triangles after the flip were non-existent. However, after debugging, I realized that we only need to reassign the half-edge of the triangles. Because we only conducted edge flips, we were not supposed to create any new elements.

			  <h3 align="middle">Part 5: Edge Flip</h3>
			  <p>
				To implement the edge split operation, we did something similar to part 4 — reassigning elements to account for the split operation. We first listed all the elements involved in the operation, including half-edges, vertices, edges, and faces. Unlike part 4, we need to create new vertices, half-edges, edges, and faces. Since split into four new edges ( one can be modified from an existing edge), we need to create 3 new edges,  6 new half-edges, and 2 new faces. We assigned the newly created half-edges, edges, and faces to their corresponding half-edges, edges, and faces. One bug I encountered was I thought I needed to create 4 new edges, 8 new half-edges, and 4 new faces. But I forgot that we needed to consider the existing vertices, edges, and faces too. Instead of creating more, we need to first reassign them.

				To split edges on the boundary, we only consider the input edge’s face which is non-boundary. Here’s what we got on the beetle model:

			  <h3 align="middle">Part 6: Loop Subdivision for Mesh Upsampling</h3>
			  <p>We implemented loop subdivision through five steps. The first step was iterating through all of the vertices in the mesh to calculate the new positions they would have once the loop subdivision is complete. The second step was then iterating through all edges present in the mesh to calculate the position of the new vertices that would be added, and store them in the  edges for later. The third step was then to go through all of the edges in the loop once again and split them, ensuring only the old edges were split and not any new ones. During this process, the edges that were split would have the vector3D stored in their newPosition variable to the newPosition variable of the newly made vertex. This was followed by the fourth step were all new edges that connected an old vertex to a new vertex were flipped. The final step was to then update the position of all vertices with the position stored in newPosition.
				<br></br>
				Loop subdivision causes cornerns and edges to become more round with each subsequent loop.

				<p>If all of the edges that are on a face are split first, followed by splitting all sharp edges, then running the new mesh through loop subdivision does preserve the sharpness of the corners and edges far better then running the base mesh through the subdivision.</p>

					<td>
					  <img src="images/6.4.png" align="middle" width="400px"/>

				<p>The cube can be pre-procesed to become more symmetrical as it is subdivided. To do that a series of flips are done so all face edges converge to one of two corners that are opposite of each other. This causes the cube to become more symmetrical across the plane the corresponding diagonal as shown below.
				</p>

				<tr>
					<td>
					  <img src="images/6.6.png" align="middle" width="400px"/>

					   </tr>
					   <tr>
				
				  </tr>

				
				<br></br>

				<p>The more edges that converge at a corner, the more prominent it stays after subdivision. By causing the face edges to converge onto two opposite vertices, you effectively create a plane that the subdivision gets closer to, making it so the other vertices become more rounded, and the focused vertices become stay visible, so that the resulting object is symmetrical.
